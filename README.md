# AODV

An implementation of the Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing 
algorithm in C. 

**NOTE: Some of the source code for this application was omitted as it targeted
a proprietary device. An empty block comment indicates that code was removed. 
As a result, the code will not run in its current state, but may be adapted 
to run on other devices and may serve as an example for the implementation of 
the AODV routing algorithm.**

### AODV Routing

Details about the AODV routing algorithm can be found in 
[RFC 3561](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3561).

### Android Device Connections

An example of another AODV application that targeted Android devices but is 
compatible with this application via UDP is 
[Connected Crossroad](https://github.com/fdfea/connected-crossroad).
